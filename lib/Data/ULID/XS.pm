=head1 NAME

Data::ULID::XS - XS backend for ULID generation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::ULID::XS qw(ulid binary_ulid);

  # use like Data::ULID

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module replaces some parts of L<Data::ULID> that are performance-critical
with XS counterparts. Its interface should be the same as Data::ULID, but you
get free XS speedups.

B<Beta quality>: while this module works well in general cases, it may also
contain errors common to C code like memory leaks or access violations. Please
do report if you encounter any problems.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Same as L<Data::ULID>. All functions should work exactly the same, but the
generation part of C<ulid> and C<binary_ulid> should be XS-boosted.

=head1 BENCHMARK

Comparing speeds of Perl and XS implementations:

	                Rate   perl_text perl_binary     xs_text   xs_binary
	perl_text   109194/s          --        -68%        -83%        -88%
	perl_binary 342646/s        214%          --        -46%        -62%
	xs_text     629138/s        476%         84%          --        -31%
	xs_binary   908050/s        732%        165%         44%          --

Benchmark ran on Thinkpad T480 (i7-8650U) and FreeBSD 12.3.
